OKSTATE Thesis Class
====================

This is the updated (circa Feb 2013) thesis class to match Oklahoma State University's thesis formatting requirements.

I originally started making my own, but Suci gave me this, which is apparently the work of these fine gentlemen:

* author: Brian O'Dell
* revised: Ryan T. Ratliff  2005

Hopefully it passes muster with the graduate college. 
I changed the name from osuthesis to okstate-thesis because I broke compatability, especially with the signature pages.


Have a look at thesis_main.tex to see how I formatted some text copied from my department's homepage. 
Hopefully it works for you, but I am not responsible if you fail to graduate due to a poorly formatted thesis.
